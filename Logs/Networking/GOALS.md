# Goals regarding Networking as of August 2nd, 2025

## Note: Next priority following my Hardware and Software will be this

## Priority List:
1. Look into setting up a network cluster for data work
2. Dive deeper into protocols and rules (further than A+ objectives)
3. Prepare for Network+ Exam

## Estimation of Goal change:
October 29th, if the Network+ exam is not complete, revaluate, sooner as more information arises.

## Log Notes:
Logs will pertain to my lab work with my network of computers as I optimize and bring them into my cluster.
