Software Troubleshooting log June 3 2025

# Issue: Obsidian Vault Lockup
## **Symptoms:
- App locking up shortly after boot
## Diagnosis:
- Hung background process from community plugin (Git)
## Methodology:
1. Identify problem - the software seems to lock up shortly after start up
2. Theory of probable cause - Hung background process
3. Testing theory 
	1. Task manager shut down of app - didn't work
	2. Reboot of computer - didn't work
	3. Shutting down all community plugins - "operation aborted" message on shutdown of git
4. Verifying results - Writing notes now just fine
5. Preventative measures - check compatibility of excalidraw and related plugins with Git plugin
6. Document - here :)
## Reflection:
- Plugin behavior for applications is booted shortly after start, coterminous with this lock-up
- Plugin behavior persists even if there is a clear error or incompatibility (no file validation?)
- Now aware about safe-mode boots for software, logging
