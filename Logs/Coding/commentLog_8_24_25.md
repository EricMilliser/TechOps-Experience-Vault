## Description
I have updated with basic comments in the intake script. This was a minor step of rough documentation not following any manner of atypical forms
of documentation found in the Tech sector. 

## Steps to do further:
> 1. Write code to intake information from CSV to MySQL
> 2. Update the intake script for better functionallity and potential streamlining
> 3. Study Google or Microsoft's standard of coding documentation and implement it
