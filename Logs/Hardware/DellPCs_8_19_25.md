## Devices: Dell Computers
## Database ID: 1, 2


## Description:
I have found and prepared the fixes for the proprietary lock of the BIOS that prevents my modification to make these computers more oriented towards
network and work based, rather than gaming. I'll have to double check rules and regulations, and of course the terms of use with the provider to
make sure this doesn't void anything that I have already paid for. While the devices are entirely in my own possession, I do not want to remove
support from Dell, as the fix requires a high risk change that affects the ROM.

## Steps I would perform:
> 1. Clone the SSDs onto a server grade HDD. (Perform routine checks of integrity on the HDD after)
> 2. Back up the ROM on multiple flash drives.
> 3. Reset the Computer to factory defaults
> 4. Test setting changes within the UEFI as first solution (turning RAID mode to ACHI) If this allows the boot into USB, document and verify full functionality, else proceed to next step
> 5. Flash the ROM with hidden setting changes that are not accesible in the UEFI (Verify full functionality following)
> (In case none of these fixes work, proceed to do further research and revert the computer with backups.)

## Further Notes:
I am actively checking my documents that Dell provided me upon acquiring the comptuer and their website, verifying that this is not a nullifying change. In case I cannot find anything,
I will give their support line a call with a full length description of the changes I wish to make. HDD still hasn't arrived yet, that is set for later this month.
