# Projects Folder


## Statement:
Within my projects folder, I have structured it to reflected a tiered system to organize my portfolio projects by the level
of depth they went into. The lower the tier (with the exception of tier-J), the less complex the project. Within the
more advanced tiers, they are often directly related to other repositories or collaboration work with open-source projects.
Any work within this repository is specifically algorithms and files that I personally have created or worked extensively on.

Note: This is not a full representation of all my works, just an organized system that reflects parts of the work.



The description of the tiers is as follows:

### Tier-1:
Small and short projects often relating to minor task of varying degrees. Includes tasks: data processing, organization &
sorting, automatic naming, data clearing, and other small and mundane tasks of automation.
### Tier-2:
Mild length projects that often serve more than one simple function. Projects in here are often equivelant to multiple
Tier-1 projects compiled into one file and algorithm. 
### Tier-3:
Moderate projects that often reflect more complex structures and algorithms, with focuses varying and beginning to focus
more towards specific niche tasks that I needed processed or done throughout my experience. At this tier and beyond, 
projects can often include more than one file.
### Tier-4:
Complex projects that reflect advanced and multifaceted skills, often combining knowledge from multiple niches or designed
programs that include readily ease of access.
### Tier-5:
Extensive and most in-depth projects within my portfolio. Often reflect deepest work and are directly related to extensive
focused projects within my repos. Any project in this will have its own designated folder and a link to the correlated 
repository in the description markdown.

(Tier-J: See description inside for more details, this is not officially related to my work.)
