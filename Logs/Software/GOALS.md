# Goals regarding Software as of August 2nd, 2025

## Note: This is one of my current priorities

## Priority List:
1. Learn how to work around various driver related issues in Linux Kernals
2. Learn how to optimize mainly Windows 11, removing excess power and utilities that take up too much of hardware space
3. Finalize documentations regarding OS and software debugging from extensive lab work of optimizing my workstations

## Estimation of Goal Change:
Revaluate goals August 31st, continue extensive studies and work on the matter.

## Log Notes:
Logs pertaining to software will be entirely built around my works with mainly optmizing OS installs and the various tools that I use daily.
