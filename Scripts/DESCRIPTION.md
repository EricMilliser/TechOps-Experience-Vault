# Scripts Description:

## Statement:
The scripts directory is where I store specifically useful scripts with focuses towards my lab work. They are specifically
focused one my process of working with the various devices I have acquired, as depending on the make & model, I like to 
personally go through extensive processes of adding them into my files. Scripts can include: automatic updates for project
files, intake scripts to gather data formatted into my database, & and many other mundane tasks often performed when I 
first acquire a machine.
