# Tier 4 Description

## NOTE: My current focus is less so on projects and more so on lesser scripts and general knowledge. I want to make sure I am well rounded out in the rudimentary knowledge of IT so that I can be qualified for higher and lower level positions. My plan is to approach everything holistically with computers and IT.
