## Device: Thinkpad X series (not personally owned)

## Database ID: (not relevant)

## Description:
User wanted me to set up a mobile workstation class laptop to minimize distractions and increase productivity for college work. Computer initially tested, no issues, good condition.

## Update Report:
> 1. Installed private browser Brave with extensions to do the following:
>    Block Ads, Block Trackers, Minimize YouTube front-end
> 2. Installed various applications related to productivity and software limiting within windows 11.
> 3. Within Hosts txt file within windows, blocked majority of video game providers (Steam, Roblox, Epic, etc.)
> 4. Verified full functionality and confirmed that this was what the user desired.


## Further Documentation:
This is an extension of my current setup, focusing entirely however with windows 11 instead of Ubuntu or Arch. I could do further edits, but the user will be heading to 
university within a couple days. I will verify with them later to see if they want more edits to their OS or computer. I anticipate they might want some of the bloatware
or irrelevant programs uninstalled or disabled off of windows, but I'll keep this in mind.

## Potential further edits:
Within my database, it might be wise to keep a log of users and other people I assist with their computers. I'll work on these changes over the course of the next few days in determining
the minimum viable database.
