## Project: Database File
## Description:
I have done 2 of the 3 major changes to the database I intended, but due to a formatting error, I had realized that I would have to edit the png that represents my DBMS.
Now currently, I still have to have a class table to determine the type of computer it is. Roughly though, I think that the parts list and role-assignments will be enough
for the time being. While to be a strong technician, I need to be able to identify certain computer types, it is better to have rote memorization on chipsets and
hardware to know what is good or not for classes, rather than simplifying it in my database.


## Key feature changes:
> {COMPLETED}: Add ticketing capabilities in case I have reoccuring users. 
> {COMPLETED}: Update database files to include various devices that I can run into
> {MISSED}: Add the various classes of computers to the PC descriptions (ie gaming, consumer-grade, workstation, lab, university)
>> Note that this was intentional

## Further notes:
Working ahead, I need to start planning for upscaling my DBMS. I will use this DB for now, as it appears to be viable enough to hold the data I will be needing for logs
related to my technician experience.
