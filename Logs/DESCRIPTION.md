# Log Files Description

## Statement:
The log files is essentially my quick wrote notes of experience in lab work and the field of working on computers. Each
respective skill line and focus is organized by folder name. Each log can reflect how I iteratively do work over time,
sometimes I put down one computer for the time being after escalating down the troubleshooting methodology. This also
acts as a documentation of important observations I make throughout the day. These logs are structured by topic, and 
follow along with the CompTIA Troubleshooting methodology.


## Further Notes:
If the computer or device is one that I currently have in my possession or actively in my lab, you can find it in my
SQL database I regularly update.
