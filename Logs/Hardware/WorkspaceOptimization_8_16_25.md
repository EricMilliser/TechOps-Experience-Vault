## Device: Dell Laptop
## Database ID: 2

## Description:
I have completely moved around my workstation to provide for more solid workflow and productivity, and potential increases later on. Due to 
my laptop being a gaming class, requiring 330W, it is impossible to find a docking station that can properly provide for this computer,
thus, I had to improvise. Now this was purely focused on my Windows 11 setup with this computer, my Ubuntu setup has some problems
with my GPU drivers and cannot run more than one monitor.

## Changelog:
> 1. Set up dual monitor desk in open area with little distractions
> 2. Set up digitizer tablet for my mindmapping and obsidian vault framework
> 3. Set up fruther quick access to most used applications
> 4. Cleared up software and the sort that was irrelevant to my current setup.


## Future changes:
> 1. Replace TN, high refresh rate monitor originally used in a gaming setup with a VA monitor
> 2. External ergonomic keyboard (Moonlander model)
> 3. Setting up Neovim for windows as well (Software oriented)
> 4. Removing of windows redundant software (windows 11 has a lot of this)

## Further Notes:
Workspace seems much clearer and so far has allowed me to work on a lot of tasks I had oriented for today while still staying
within a relatively short time frame.
