## Devices: Thrifted Chromebooks
## Database ID: 3, 4, 5, 6

## Description:
Following the powerwash cycle, I had set up a basic user and connected all 4 to my lab WiFi. This is the first step of the process to set up the new OS, however, due
to the fact that some of these chromebooks are different models, the process will not be the same for all of them following this step. I will begin working with them
more specifically one by one to set them up properly, but the sources I am using for this process recommends doing it one at a time.

## Process:
> 1. Follow prompts to set up superuser

## Further Notes:
I will continue this process tomorrow, my notes on the matter for the processing of the computers will take some time and potentially some
deviations from a linear procedure due to the specifications I have not entirely identified yet.
