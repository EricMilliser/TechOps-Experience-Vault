## Device: Thrifted Chromebooks
## Database ID: 3, 4, 5, 6

## Description:
Today I took efforts to perform the powerwash functionality on my thrifted chromebooks. This was a relatively simple process, and took little effort. This was done in preperation of my
conversion of the Chromebook's native ChromeOS to a more suitable OS for my cluster that I am working on.

## Process:
1. On all four of the ChromeBooks, hold Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R on login, accept prompts, process begins.


## Further Notes: 
Continuation of this process in software logs.
