## Device: Thrifted Chromebooks
## Datrabase ID: 3, 4, 5, 6

## Description:
I've looked into the hardware regarding the the ChromeBooks I have acquired. While I can install Crostini, the hardware and software do not seem entirely compatible with my goals in mind. I am going to furthermore verify
the full powerwash and removal of the personal information that was on them, run a few HDD checks, make sure they are safe to resell or remove from my posessions.

## Further Notes:
Going forward, I need to strongly check the devices prior to acquiring them. While these devices I acquired for free, extensive searching of the devices and models that I am acquiring prior to accepting them is critical
for a long-term networking based strategy.
