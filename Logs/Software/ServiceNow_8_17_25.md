## Description:
I am currently working on setting up a service now ticketing software for keeping track of all my data and active
computer tickets outside of my database. Potentially, if possible later down the line, I would like to implement
the ServiceNow software directly with MySQL integration. There are software to allow this workflow automation.

## Further notes:
This is to increase my experience with higher level projects and more rounded out systems. I potentially need to work on
a workflow on my end, not front-facing.
