## Device: Cluster 1
## Database ID: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

## Description:
This log is detailing my networking process where I am exploring options for a proper network cluster setup with my
current 6 computers. Currently, I am trying to find the most easy-access and low-level way to have these devices 
communicate effectively.

## Potential Solutions:
> 1. A mentor suggested on the Chromebooks setting up a GNOME kernel on each of them, designated to their specific role,
>    then setting up on my main 2 PCs the forefront of the data processing and instructions.
> 2. Setting up a proper network device to allow easier communication between just the baseline windows 11 operating systems
>    and the ChromeOS for starters. This would require a different ISP and network infrastructure, currently out of budget.


## Drawback:
Noting that I do not have the means as of right now to do either low level or network based connections, it might be best
to wait until my HDD arrives to clone my computers in preperation for imaging the Arch OS.
