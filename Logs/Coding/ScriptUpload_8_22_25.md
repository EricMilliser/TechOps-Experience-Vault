## Description:
I have created a rudimentary script for checking the system information extremely quickly with python.
Currently, it needs more comments, and all that sort of deal. I also want to use some tools to
convert it into an executable for windows, and just run the code directly from a terminal in Linux.

## Further notes:
This is my first automation script. I think that I might create automation scripts for installing
certain drivers that are required to have full functionality on various OSes I use.
