## Device: Dell Tower and Laptop
## Database ID: 1, 2
## Description:
This is a log to account for my ongoing work with my laptop and desktop PCs, which have proprietary issues with the firmware and board that have proven to be
tedious to overcome for modifications. 

## Diagnostics:
> 1. Situation: My computers that I acquired through Dell I have found over the course of my modifications are immensely locked down via proprietary tech.
>    The BIOS is locked into multiple values that do not allow me to boot into a USB (I can only boot via NvME interfaces), for modifications. There is also
>    a problem regarding that both PCs came with locked down in RAID mode. I need to extensively modify them.
> 2. Theory of probable cause: From looking into my specific PC models, I am seeing that there are hidden settings that I have to flash into the ROM to allow
>    modifications further. I also, furthermore, should promptly back up the current ROM with the latest version and all of my data. I have verified that the
>    chipsets allow for the modifications I wish to perform, however, I might have driver issues with other hardware (such as my NVIDIA GPU).
> 3. Proposed steps of further action: I have ordered a HDD to clone my data from both of these computers comfortably. I also have 2 USBs on hand to clone the
>    ROM in case I perform something incorrectly.

## Further Notes:
Projects halted until HDD arrives for full cloning.
