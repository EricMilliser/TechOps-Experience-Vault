## Project: Database File

## Description:
I am realizing that my skills in documentation, ticketing and that realm almost entirely depends on having a strong database to pull from. Here, I am logging for further iterations of my fully functioning database what will
be the crux to my refined knowledge base. 

## Key feature changes:
> 1. Add ticketing capabilities in case I have reoccuring users.
> 2. Update database files to include various devices that I can run into
> 3. Add the various classes of computers to the PC descriptions (ie gaming, consumer-grade, workstation, lab, university)

## Things to avoid:
> 1. Personal information of users, currently it is outside my scope to provide security to that sort of thing. If it comes to the point where they become clients,
>    suggested action to outsource through 3rd party.
> 2. Overcomplication of database structure: I need to keep almost all entities seperate following my database diagrams and understanding of the DBMS. Also, considering
>    I am using the community version of MySQL, I am tethered to my devices and their capabilities.
> 3. Expanding into rigourous business territory: outside of scope, skills are more fundamental right now.


## Further Notes:
I will be working to update this database over the course of going through an extensive use-case scenario. It appears that I need to determine the depth I wish to proceed with this.
